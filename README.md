## 📖 About Us

**openQuire** is an organization dedicated to creating transparent, accessible, and user-owned productivity software. 

The name **"Quire"** refers to a set of paper sheets folded together — the foundational building block of traditional note-taking. We combine this classic concept with modern open-source philosophy to build tools that empower you to capture, organize, and share ideas without lock-in.

### 🎯 Our Mission
- **Ownership:** Your data belongs to you. No proprietary clouds, no hidden tracking.
- **Transparency:** Open code, open development, open roadmaps.
- **Community:** Built by users, for users. Every contribution counts.
